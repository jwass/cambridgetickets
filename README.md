# Cambridge Parking Tickets

This is a project for Maptime Boston's show-and-tell on October 21, 2014.

Data for two web maps are created:
* [Heat map](http://jwass.github.io/cambridgetickets/heat.html) of where parking tickets are issued in the City
* [Parking ticket rate map](http://jwass.github.com/cambridgetickets/density.html). Adjusts with zoom level to show how many
tickets per parking meter are issued in a given region.
